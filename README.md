RethinkDB-Ruby
==============

This is a simple fork of the ruby code which was installed by v1.6.x of the rethinkdb gem.

Differences between this and the original
=========================================

No Warnings
-----------

The original was clogging my logs with too many warnings.  I couldn't see what was going on due to all the extra junk messages about uninitialized variables.

(That is all).

Usage
-----

Please do not use this for anything.
